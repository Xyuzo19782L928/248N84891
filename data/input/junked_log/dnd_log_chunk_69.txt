Return to Stone Raven Keep: Supplies and Gear Maintenance
The Arrowheads make their way back to Stone Raven Keep, the bustling hub of trade and defense in the region. As you walk through its gates, the sounds of merchants haggling and blacksmiths hammering metal fill the air.

1. Visiting the Blacksmith
The group heads to the familiar forge of Arvil Ironbrand, the seasoned blacksmith whose work is renowned in the area. Arvil wipes his hands on a soot-covered apron as you approach.

Arvil: “Ah, the Arrowheads, back from another adventure, I see. What can I do for you this time? Repairs, upgrades, or something new altogether?”

Options:
Repair all damaged gear (estimated cost: 15 gp for standard upkeep).
Inquire about upgrades or enhancements to your current weapons or armor.
Look for new weapons, shields, or armor in the shop.
Trade or sell items you no longer need.
Ask about custom orders.
2. Supplies Market
From the blacksmith, the group can head to the market square. Stalls line the streets, offering everything from dried meats to magical components.

Restocking Options:
Rations (1 gp per day per person): Stock up for the journey to the ruins.
Torches (1 sp each): Essential for dark ruins.
Healing Potions (50 gp each): A bit pricey, but invaluable in a pinch.
Other Items: Let me know if there’s something specific you’re looking for.
Current Gold Tally: 200 gp

Du:
Restock as the group thinks it's useful. Then repair the equipment we have and ask what enhancements we can get with the left over gold

# Calculating the group's expenses for restocking and repairs

# Initial gold amount

healing_potions_cost = 3 * 50
torches_cost = 10 * 0.1  # 10 torches at 1 silver piece each

restocking_cost = rations_cost + healing_potions_cost + torches_cost

What will the Arrowheads decide? ​​





Du:
Okay, let's not spent our last gold too quickly. As long as we are in stoneravenkeep, let's check on the oath keepers. How many days has it been since we were last here? Something like 2-3? 
ChatGPT:
The Arrowheads have been away from Stone Raven Keep for about three days, accounting for:

One day spent traveling to and dealing with the stone ring.
One day spent resolving the situation with Elric and returning to Stone Raven Keep.
One day spent gathering supplies and repairs.
Checking on the Oathbound
You head to the refurbished barracks, where the Oathbound have been working to establish themselves. Upon arrival, you find Ashara and Grim training with the other members. The barracks are livelier, with basic repairs visibly underway.

Ashara approaches first, wiping sweat from her brow.
“Back already? Things are progressing well. We’ve been working hard on training and keeping things orderly. I’ve even been in touch with a few merchants about potential escort contracts.”

Grim adds, his tone gruff but steady, “The team’s shaping up. Still, we’re short on gear for some tasks. Wouldn’t mind more funds or loot to get the rest fully equipped.”

Progress Report
Barracks Repairs: 50% complete; some rooms still need fixing, but they’re functional.
Training: The Oathbound are improving in combat cohesion, but they lack higher-grade weapons and armor.
Contracts: Two merchant contracts are lined up but will require approval and finalization.
Options:
Approve the merchant contracts Ashara mentioned.
Discuss priorities for further improvements (gear, training, or facilities).
Offer the remaining gold (14 gp) to assist with immediate needs.
Spend time training with the Oathbound to boost their readiness.
Check their progress further before intervening.




Du:
We don't need to approve contracts. this is up to Ashara and grim. Let's search our inventory on what we can turn into gold. The 14 coins we have won't be much help

There seems to be a mix-up in inventory types. Let me manually calculate it based on what I recall from our journey.

Sellable Items:
Garnet: Already sold earlier for 20 gp.
Jeweled Dagger: 40 gp.
Minor Trinkets: Approximate value of 5 gp.
Remaining Sellable Items:
Only the jeweled dagger and minor trinkets can be sold now, potentially yielding 45 gp.

Would you like to:

Sell the jeweled dagger and minor trinkets for additional funds?
Keep the jeweled dagger, as it might have other uses or value beyond its gold worth?
Reassess the inventory further to confirm no other valuables exist? ​​




Du:
Let kael cast detect magic on the dagger. If nothing comes up, we can sell it together with the miners trinket and give the gold to the oathbound. Did we already store the stone circle items? If not, let's do that and tell them to guard it with all they have
ChatGPT:
Casting Detect Magic on the Jeweled Dagger
Kael concentrates, uttering the incantation for Detect Magic, his hands glowing faintly as his senses attune to the energies surrounding the dagger. A moment later, he shakes his head.

Kael: "Nothing magical here. It’s a finely made dagger, but that’s all it is. You can sell it without concern."

Selling the Jeweled Dagger and Minor Trinkets
You head to a trusted merchant in Stone Raven Keep, who inspects the items and offers:

Jeweled Dagger: 40 gp
Minor Trinkets: 5 gp
Total Gold Gained: 45 gp

With this, your gold tally increases to 59 gp.

Storing the Stone Circle Items
Returning to the Oathbound Barracks, you gather Ashara and Grim. Placing the stone circle items (the pendant, rune fragment, figurine, and ritual flowers) in a secured chest, you explain their importance.

Napy: “These items are vital to keeping the balance of the stone circle. They’re to be guarded with everything you’ve got. No one—and I mean no one—touches these without my approval or one of my team’s.”

Ashara salutes.
“Understood. We’ll assign guards to watch this chest round the clock.”

Grim adds, “Anyone tries anything, they’ll regret it.”

The items are stored safely, and the Oathbound take their duty seriously.

Next Steps:
Distribute the 59 gp to the Oathbound for immediate needs or repairs.
Use some of the gold to restock personal party supplies or save for later.
Check for new leads or prepare for the expedition to the ancient ruins.




Du:
Give 50 gold to the oathbound. Then let's rest for the night at the barracks and get up early tomorrow to go for the ancient ruins. Let's see how the oathbound are in shape next time we visit. I was hoping they would make money, not set it on fire.
ChatGPT:
Gold Distribution to the Oathbound
You hand over 50 gold pieces to Ashara and Grim.

Napy: "Use this wisely—for repairs, gear, or anything essential. Remember, this is your seed money. I expect the Oathbound to start turning a profit soon, not bleeding gold."

Ashara nods earnestly.
"Understood. We’ll make sure it’s put to good use."

Grim smirks.
"Don’t worry, boss. We’re not about to waste it. You’ll see results next time you’re here."

Night at the Barracks
The Arrowheads settle into a corner of the refurbished barracks. Though still modest, the space is clean, functional, and warm. You enjoy a night of rest, knowing the Oathbound are taking their duties seriously. The chest containing the stone circle items is under guard, and all seems secure.

Morning Departure
At dawn, the Arrowheads rise, gathering their gear for the journey to the ancient ruins near the forest's edge. After a quick breakfast and farewells to Ashara and Grim, you set off on the road.

Gold Tally: 9 gp
XP Tally: 2,200 XP (Threshold for Level 3: 5,000 XP)
The Road to the Ancient Ruins
The journey takes you deep into the countryside, where the roads are rough, and the trees grow thicker. As you travel, the forest canopy grows denser, casting long shadows across the path. The air feels cooler, and the sounds of birds and insects grow faint.

Kael: "This place feels… different. Almost like the forest itself is holding its breath."

Options as You Approach the Ruins:
Scout ahead to observe the ruins before entering.
Approach cautiously as a group, weapons ready.
Take a moment to rest and observe the surroundings for signs of danger.
Let Lyra or Kael detect magical auras or disturbances.
Simply enter the ruins without delay.
