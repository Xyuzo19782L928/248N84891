Let's ask about the supply cache. If I remember correctly there should be 12 bandits in the main camp

Interrogation: The Supply Cache
Napy holds up the map fragment, pointing to the marked location. “What’s at this supply cache? Talk, or things get worse for you.”

Shortbow Bandit:
“It’s a backup stash... supplies and maybe a few valuables. Varric likes to keep reserves in case things go south. Mostly food, weapons, and tools. There might be some coin, but don’t count on anything fancy.”

Dagger Bandit:
“It’s guarded, though. Two or three guys are stationed there. They’re not expecting trouble, but they’ll fight if someone comes poking around.”

Information Gained:
The supply cache is lightly guarded (2-3 bandits).
It contains basic supplies (food, weapons, tools) and potentially some coin or other small valuables.
The guards are not particularly vigilant.
Options:

Ask About Varric: Gather more information on the bandit leader.
Ask About the Main Hideout: Confirm defenses and strategies for the central camp.
Plan to Visit the Supply Cache: Prioritize raiding it before addressing the hideout.
What does Napy decide?





Du:
Tie them up, and bring all 6 bandits to stonravenkeep. We need to talk to the guards again

Returning to Ravenstone Keep
The journey back is slow, with six bound bandits in tow. The party keeps a watchful eye on their captives, ensuring no one tries anything foolish. By the time you arrive at the gates of Ravenstone Keep, the guards are visibly surprised.

Guard 1:
“Six this time? You’re making a habit of this.”

Guard 2:
“We’ll take them off your hands. You’re doing more to clear the roads than we are lately.”

Discussing the Situation
The guards quickly secure the bandits in the barracks. You’re given an opportunity to explain what you’ve learned about the supply cache and the main hideout.

Options:

Propose Raiding the Supply Cache: Suggest the guards support you in taking out the cache.
Focus on the Main Hideout: Plan a direct assault on Varric’s base.
Request Additional Rewards: Negotiate for more gold due to the growing danger.
What does Napy do?





Du:
Tell them about the supply cache. We might be able to take out the bandits guarding the supplies and poison the supplies. May not be the most heroic feat, but, I mean, let's make the bandits stop

Discussing the Supply Cache Plan
Napy:
“There’s a supply cache near the hideout. Lightly guarded, with food, weapons, and maybe some coin. If we can take out the guards and sabotage the supplies—poison the food or otherwise ruin their resources—it could cripple the main camp without a direct fight.”

Guard 1:
“That’s a clever plan. Desperate bandits don’t fight as well, and without supplies, they’ll start turning on each other.”

Guard 2:
“You’ll need something strong for poisoning their food, though. We don’t keep that kind of thing here. Maybe check with the apothecary or Arlen?”

Options:
Visit the Apothecary: Find poison or other tools to sabotage the supplies.
Head Straight for the Cache: Rely on combat to deal with the guards and disable the cache.
Request Guard Support: Ask the guards to assist in the supply raid.
What does Napy decide?





Du:
Go to arlen and tell him directly what we plan to do. No chit chat with him as I remember

Visiting Arlen’s Enclave
The party makes their way back to the familiar iron-wrought gates of Arlen’s Enclave. Inside, the wizard is hunched over a desk, scribbling runes onto a parchment. He doesn’t look up as you enter but speaks in his usual gravelly tone.

Arlen:
“You again. What do you need this time? Make it quick.”

Napy:
“There’s a supply cache for the bandits we’re dealing with. We plan to poison it and weaken their main forces. Do you have anything that could help?”

Arlen:
The old wizard raises an eyebrow and slowly stands, moving to a shelf lined with vials. He pulls down a small bottle with a dark green liquid.

“This will do the trick. A potent toxin—won’t kill outright, but it’ll make anyone who consumes it too sick to fight. Works best if mixed into food or drink.”

Cost of the Toxin:
30 gold for a vial, enough to poison all the supplies at the cache.
Options:

Purchase the Toxin: Pay 30 gold and proceed with the plan.
Negotiate for a Lower Price: Attempt to haggle with Arlen.
Decline: Look for alternative ways to sabotage the cache.
What does Napy decide?

Resting at the Inn
The party settles into the comfort of the inn for the night, the weight of recent battles momentarily lifted. The warm hearth and hearty food provide a sense of calm as everyone regroups.

Toran:
“Not a bad plan, taking out their supplies first. If tomorrow goes as smoothly, we might have the edge we need.”

Lyra:
“Let’s hope we don’t need too much luck. Rest up—we’ll need all our strength.”

Kael:
“And no more arrows for me, thank you very much.”

Long Rest Benefits:
All HP restored.
Spell slots fully replenished.
Everyone is at full capacity, ready for the challenges ahead.
In the morning, the party is refreshed and ready to head for the supply cache. Any additional plans before departing?





Du:
Let's discuss whether we can involve the guards. If things don't go as planned, we have a dozen bandits against us.

Discussing the Guards’ Role
Over breakfast at the inn, the party gathers to discuss the risks ahead.

Napy:
“We’re talking about a dozen bandits at the main hideout, plus whatever trouble we might run into at the supply cache. If things don’t go as planned, we could use some backup. Should we involve the guards?”

Toran:
“Guards would be useful, no doubt. But they’re spread thin as it is, and if they’re with us, the bandits might scatter instead of staying to fight.”

Lyra:
“It’s a balance. Backup could save lives, but it might tip our hand too early.”

Kael:
“Perhaps we could ask them to stay nearby but out of sight. That way, they’re there if we need them but don’t spook the bandits right away.”

Options:
Request Guard Backup: Ask the guards to accompany the party to the supply cache and beyond.
Ask for Guards on Standby: Arrange for them to stay close but hidden, ready to step in if called.
Go Alone: Avoid involving the guards and stick with the party’s current plan.
What does Napy decide?





Du:
Ask the guards to be on standby. This is not a gold making mission. This is real danger.

Visiting the Guards
The party heads to the barracks to present the new plan. The guards listen intently as Napy explains the risks of the mission and the value of having backup close at hand.

Guard 1:
“You’ve got a point. This isn’t just about clearing bandits; it’s about stopping a real threat to the region.”

Guard 2:
“We can position a squad nearby. We’ll stay out of sight unless things go south. Signal us if you need help, and we’ll move in.”

Support Secured:
The guards agree to deploy five soldiers to a concealed position near the supply cache. They’ll wait for your signal before engaging.

Next Steps:
The party is ready to head for the supply cache. Anything else before departing?





Du:
No, let's get going. 
ChatGPT:
Heading to the Supply Cache
The party sets out toward the supply cache, accompanied discreetly by the guards, who fall back into a concealed position as the group nears the site. The journey takes several hours, with the terrain growing increasingly rugged. The faint signs of a trail lead directly to the cache’s location.

Reaching the Cache
The cache is tucked into a rocky clearing, surrounded by sparse trees. A few crates and barrels are stacked near a firepit, and two bandits patrol the area. A third sits near the fire, casually sharpening a blade. They appear relaxed, unaware of any immediate danger.

Cache Status:

Guards on Site: 3 bandits (2 patrolling, 1 at the fire).
Supplies Visible: Barrels and crates stacked near the fire, likely containing food and weapons.
Options:

Ambush the Bandits: Use stealth to eliminate or incapacitate them silently.
Distract Them: Create a diversion to draw them away from the supplies.
Confront Directly: Demand their surrender and prepare for a fight if needed.

Kael’s Distraction
Kael raises his hands, whispering an incantation. A loud crash and the sound of frantic footsteps echo from the nearby woods, convincing and well-timed. The two patrolling bandits immediately stop and move toward the source, leaving the firepit and the supplies unguarded.

Napy’s Stealth Attempt
While the distraction works, Napy’s attempt to move unnoticed falters. A loose rock shifts beneath his foot, creating a small noise. The bandit near the fire turns his head sharply toward the sound, spotting Napy as he moves toward the supplies.

Firepit Bandit:
“Oi! What’s this? Intruder!”

The Situation:
Two Bandits Distracted: They’ve moved toward Kael’s illusion but haven’t yet returned.
One Bandit Alerted: The bandit near the fire draws his weapon and prepares to attack Napy.
