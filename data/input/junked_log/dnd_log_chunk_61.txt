Next Phase of Battle
As the combat intensifies, both sides press their advantages. Your team’s coordination remains strong, with the Oathbound holding their own against the weakened bandits while the adventurers turn their focus to the lieutenants.

Enemies Take Action
Bandit Leader (Attacks Toran):

The leader, with one final surge of strength, lunges at Toran with a heavy swing of his sword, aiming to take down the most immediate threat.
Lieutenant 1 (Targets Napy):

Seeing Napy as a key threat after his devastating sneak attacks, the first lieutenant attempts a swift counterattack with their blade.
Lieutenant 2 (Targets Kael):

Spotting Kael casting spells, the second lieutenant rushes toward him, slashing with ferocity.
Remaining Bandits:

The two remaining bandits, desperate and bloodied, focus on defending themselves against the Oathbound, swinging wildly in a last-ditch effort to survive.
Let me roll for the enemies’ attacks and determine outcomes.

Thorough Search Results
Napy (27 - Critical Success):
Napy's keen eye and expertise in scouting reveal a hidden compartment beneath the leader's tent. Inside, he finds:

150 gold coins neatly stored in a small chest.
A fine leather-bound journal, marked with coded entries that may hint at other bandit alliances or hidden caches.
A set of jeweled daggers, clearly decorative but valuable, estimated at 75 gold.
Napy also uncovers a hidden stash of supplies, including:

2 healing potions.
A smoke bomb for creating distractions or covering retreats.
Kael (16):
Kael’s search reveals:

A pair of arcane gloves in one of the lieutenants’ belongings, faintly glowing with magical energy. These will need identification to understand their properties.
A crude but well-crafted map of the region, highlighting potential trade routes and ambush points.
Lyra (5):
Lyra struggles to find anything noteworthy beyond the scattered weapons and basic supplies. However, she does recover a locked strongbox, which will require Napy's skill to open.

Oathbound Leadership Discussion
After securing the camp, the group gathers to discuss the performance of the Oathbound. Notable observations:

Grim: Calm and tactical, effectively directing his peers during the charge.
Ashara: Fearless and decisive, delivering critical blows and inspiring confidence among the group.
Kieran: Quietly effective but lacks the assertiveness shown by the other two.
The adventurers should weigh in on who might be the best fit to lead.

Immediate Next Steps:
Attempt to open the strongbox.
Discuss and vote on Oathbound leadership based on performance.
Decide how to proceed with the recovered loot and information.
