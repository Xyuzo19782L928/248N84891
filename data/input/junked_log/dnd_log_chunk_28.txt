Napy’s Bluff Roll: 7

Result: Failure

Attempting the Bluff
Napy raises his hands, speaking with confidence. “Whoa, easy there! I’m not here to fight. I heard you lot were planning something clever down here, and I thought we might work together. I’ve got supplies, and I know a trick or two with traps.”

The bandit narrows his eyes, clearly unconvinced.

Bandit 2:
“Supplies, eh? Sounds like you’re more of a mark than a mate. Best step back before I send this bolt flying.”

The situation is tense, with the crossbow trained squarely on Napy.

Options:

Attack First: Try to disarm or incapacitate the bandit before he fires.
Double Down on Bluff: Make another attempt with more urgency.
Signal the Group: Call for backup to handle the situation.
What does Napy do? ​​





Du:
Double down on the bluff. Take the bow of his shoulder and put it on the ground as a way to show that we mean no harm

The Bluff Fails
Napy slowly reaches for the crossbow, intending to place it on the ground as a gesture of good faith. However, the bandit’s suspicion only deepens, and he steps back, keeping his weapon trained on Napy.

Bandit 2:
“Nice try, mate, but I wasn’t born yesterday. Drop whatever you’re holding and get on the ground. You’re not walking out of here unless I say so.”

The bandit’s voice rises, likely alerting his partner behind the tree.

Options:

Attack Immediately: Take advantage of the bandit’s slight distraction and strike.
Signal the Group: Call for backup to handle the escalating situation.
Surrender for Now: Comply to avoid immediate violence and look for another opening.
What does Napy do? ​​





Du:
Comply for now. Let's keep talking and see where this is heading
ChatGPT:
Complying with the Bandit
Napy raises his hands in mock surrender, stepping back slowly. “Alright, alright, no need to get jumpy. I’m just trying to avoid trouble. Let’s talk. Maybe we’re both after the same thing, yeah?”

The bandit, still wary, keeps his crossbow trained on Napy but doesn’t fire. His partner, the sword-wielding bandit, emerges from behind the fallen tree, alerted by the commotion.

Bandit 1 (Sword):
“What’s this, then? Found someone snooping, did you?”

Bandit 2 (Crossbow):
“He says he’s not trouble, just... nosy. I don’t trust him.”

The Bandits Confer
The two bandits exchange glances, clearly trying to decide whether to attack, rob, or simply dismiss Napy. Their hesitation offers a sliver of an opening.

Options:

Play on Their Greed: Offer to share “supplies” (bluff that you have something valuable).
Distract Them: Create an opening for the rest of the party to act.
Continue Talking: Appeal to their logic or laziness, suggesting you’re not worth the trouble.
Signal the Party: Let the group handle the situation as a united front.
What does Napy do?





Du:
Let's offer them a deal the first person to come along the path, I will capture and give them whatever the person carries. Free of charge. They can take nice break and I will come back in about 2-3 hours with whatever I can rob

Striking a Deal
Napy gestures calmly, his voice steady. “Here’s the deal: you two take a nice break. Let me handle the next poor soul to come down this road. I’ll bring back whatever they’ve got—free of charge. No need for you to lift a finger.”

The two bandits exchange skeptical glances, but the promise of an easy payday softens their stances. The crossbow-wielding bandit lowers his weapon slightly, his lips curling into a smirk.

Bandit 1 (Sword):
“That’s bold, mate. You think you can pull it off?”

Bandit 2 (Crossbow):
“Fine. Two hours. But if you try anything funny, we’ll track you down. Don’t make us regret this.”

The Bandits’ Agreement:

They accept Napy’s offer to “work” for them temporarily.
They retreat to the underbrush to wait, keeping a close eye on the path.
Next Steps:

Regroup with the Party: Use this opportunity to plan a counter-ambush.
Set a Trap for the Bandits: Double-cross them with a pre-planned trick.
Feign Participation: Pretend to rob someone and return with a decoy “loot.”
What does Napy decide? ​​





Du:
I set a trap next to the tree where the one bandit was sitting. I wait after that for the two hours and feign participation until I return to the two to bring them 10gp

Setting the Trap
Napy expertly rigs a trap near the fallen tree, ensuring that anyone stepping into the area would trigger a snare designed to immobilize or disorient them. The setup is subtle, blending seamlessly with the surrounding underbrush.

Feigning Participation
Over the next two hours, Napy waits patiently, keeping the bandits unaware of his true intentions. He carefully observes their behavior, noting their overconfidence and lack of caution as they lounge nearby.

Finally, Napy approaches the pair, presenting them with 10 gold coins as “loot” from a fabricated robbery.

Bandit 1 (Sword):
“Not bad. Guess you’re not all talk after all.”

Bandit 2 (Crossbow):
“Heh, maybe we let you stick around. Could use someone with your skills.”

Next Steps:

Spring the Trap: Use the distraction to incapacitate them and secure the area.
Continue the Bluff: Use the bandits’ goodwill to extract more information.
Regroup with the Party: Leave the area and reunite with your team to plan further.
What does Napy do? ​​





Du:
I try to convince them to turn this into a 3 man deal, so we can take on larger convois. And hey, maybe the swordsman can take his old position (right ontop of my trap). What are their names btw? Maybe we should introduce

Convincing the Bandits
Napy grins, exuding confidence as he gestures to the road. “You know, this little operation of yours has potential. But two men? You’ll barely scratch the surface of what’s out there. With someone like me, we could go after bigger prey—convoys, merchants loaded with goods. A three-man team? That’s the way to make real coin.”

The bandits nod slowly, warming to the idea. The swordsman even chuckles, slapping his blade against his palm.

Bandit 1 (Sword):
“Alright, I’ll bite. Bigger jobs, more gold. I like it.” He steps toward the tree, unconsciously taking up his old position directly over Napy’s trap.

Bandit 2 (Crossbow):
“Not bad, mate. You’ve got a head for this. Name’s Brann. My mate here’s Derrick. Guess we’re partners now, eh?”

Springing the Trap:
With Derrick standing right where the snare is hidden, Napy has the perfect opportunity to incapacitate him and take control of the situation.

Options:

Spring the Trap: Activate it and subdue Derrick while taking Brann by surprise.
Continue the Bluff: Keep up the act to gain even more of their trust.
Signal the Party: Call in your team to secure the situation.
What does Napy decide? ​​





Du:
The plan is to spring the trap to incapacitate one of the two. Then I want to pull the rapier out and threaten the other one to finish him off with a swift strike unless he surrenders. The whole point is not to hurt anyone, but to capture the two. Let's try

The Plan Goes Awry
As Napy springs the trap, Derrick reacts with surprising agility, stepping back just in time to avoid being caught. He snarls, his hand tightening on his sword.

Derrick (Sword):
“A trap?! You sneaky little rat! I’ll gut you for that!”

Meanwhile, Napy’s attempt to intimidate Brann falls flat. The crossbow-wielding bandit smirks, raising his weapon with a steady aim.

Brann (Crossbow):
“Looks like you’ve run out of tricks, mate. Say your prayers.”

Situation:
Derrick: Ready to attack with his sword.
Brann: Crossbow aimed directly at Napy.
Party Status: Still unaware unless Napy signals for help.
Options:

Signal the Party: Call for backup before things escalate further.
Fight Back: Engage both bandits in combat to regain control.
Attempt to Bluff Again: Claim it was a misunderstanding and try to defuse the situation.
