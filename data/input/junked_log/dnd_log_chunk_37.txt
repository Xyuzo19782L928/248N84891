Result: Success

Bribing the Bandit
Napy raises his hands, keeping his voice calm but firm. “Here’s the deal: take 20 gold and walk away. No more questions, no more fights. You’ll live, and I won’t have to waste time dealing with you.”

The bandit hesitates, glancing nervously toward the woods where the distraction lingers, then back at Napy.

Firepit Bandit:
“...Fine. I don’t get paid enough for this anyway.”

He sheathes his weapon, grabs the gold Napy offers, and quickly disappears into the forest.

Current Situation
Firepit Bandit: Bribed and gone.
Two Distracted Bandits: Still investigating Kael’s illusion.
Supplies: Left unguarded near the fire.
Gold Spent: 20 gp.
Current Gold: 95 gp.

Signal the Party to Sabotage the Supplies: Proceed with poisoning while the bandits are distracted.

Poisoning the Supplies

Bandit 1:
“Wait a second—what’s going on here?”

They draw their weapons and begin moving toward the supplies.

Two Bandits Alerted: The remaining bandits are now suspicious and ready to engage.
Supplies Partially Poisoned: Some food and water have been sabotaged, but the job isn’t complete.
