Inspecting the Rubble
Napy crouches near the pile of debris, his torchlight casting long shadows across the jagged rocks. “Let’s make sure we don’t bring this whole place down before we start digging,” he says, pulling out the map and studying the surroundings.

The group stands at the ready, keeping a careful distance in case of sudden movement.

Perception Check
Napy will inspect the rubble for signs of further instability or hidden dangers before using tools to clear it. DC: 12. Rolling now!

Napy's Perception Roll: 14 (12 + 2 Perception bonus)
DC for Success: 12

Result: Success!

Napy’s Findings
Napy carefully examines the rubble and notices:

Stable Sections: The lower portion of the debris is firm and unlikely to shift if cleared carefully.
Unstable Rocks Above: A few loose stones overhead could fall if the pile is disturbed too quickly.
A Possible Gap: A narrow opening near the base of the rubble, barely large enough to peer through.
As Napy leans in closer, the faint sound of breathing and a weak voice reaches his ears. “Help… over here…”

Toran:
The dwarf grips his axe tightly. “He’s alive! But we’ll need to be slow—don’t want to crush him with the rocks.”

Lyra:
“I can be ready with a spell if anyone gets hurt, but let’s focus on getting him out safely.”

Kael:
Kael kneels by the rubble, torch in hand. “I could blast it, but… that’s probably a bad idea, right?”

Next Steps
Clear the Rubble Carefully: Use tools like the crowbar to dig while avoiding the unstable upper rocks. This will require a Strength or Engineering check (DC 12).
Peer Through the Gap: Try to see Callum’s condition and location before clearing. This might involve another Perception check (DC 10).
What’s Napy’s call? ​​

Clearing the Rubble
Under Napy’s guidance, Toran takes the lead with the crowbar, carefully levering loose rocks away from the pile. Lyra and Kael steady the rubble while Napy directs the effort, avoiding the unstable sections overhead.

With precise teamwork, the group clears a safe path through the debris in record time. The faint voice grows stronger, and soon, a pale, dust-covered figure emerges from the gap: Callum.

Callum’s Condition
Callum is alive but badly shaken. His left leg is pinned under a smaller rock, and he winces in pain as he looks up at you. “Thank… thank the gods,” he whispers hoarsely. “I thought… no one would come.”

Lyra:
She kneels beside him, inspecting his leg. “The bone’s not broken, but he won’t be walking on his own. We’ll need to get him out carefully.”

Toran:
The dwarf grins despite the situation. “Still breathing, lad. That’s good enough for me.”

Kael:
Kael glances nervously at the ceiling. “This place is still a death trap. Let’s patch him up and move before it decides we’re next.”

Next Steps
Heal Callum: Lyra can use a healing spell to stabilize him and ease his pain.
Carry Him Out: Toran and Napy can carry him together, carefully navigating the tunnel.
Question Him: Ask Callum about what happened before deciding your next move.

Let Lyra heal Callum and Napy talk to him
ChatGPT:
Lyra’s Healing Touch
Lyra places a hand on Callum’s shoulder, her expression gentle but firm. “You’re safe now. Let me take care of that leg.” She begins murmuring a soft prayer to Sarenrae, her hand glowing faintly with divine energy.

Healing Spell:
Lyra casts Cure Light Wounds, healing Callum’s injuries. Let’s roll for the amount healed! (1d8 + Lyra’s caster level.) Rolling now.

Callum’s Recovery
A warm glow spreads over Callum’s leg as Lyra channels her magic. His expression eases, and he lets out a shaky breath. “Feels… better. Thank you. I can move it now, I think.”

Though still weak, Callum looks much more stable and capable of sitting upright.

Napy Speaks to Callum
Napy crouches beside him, offering a reassuring smile. “You’ve had a rough time, Callum. But we need to know what happened. Why did you come this deep? Did you see anything unusual?”

Callum’s face pales slightly as he speaks, his voice trembling. “I thought I found something—a silver vein untouched by the collapse. But when I got deeper, I heard… whispers. Like voices just out of reach. The ground gave way, and next thing I knew, I was trapped here.”

He hesitates, his eyes darting toward the shadows. “There’s… something else down here. I couldn’t see it, but I felt it. Watching me. I don’t know how long I’ve been here, but… I don’t think it’s safe to stay.”

Party Reactions:
Toran:
“We’ve got what we came for. Let’s get the lad out and leave the cursed place behind.”

Lyra:
“I agree—his safety comes first. But if there’s something dangerous here, it might follow us—or worse, threaten the town.”

Kael:
Kael taps his staff nervously. “If there’s something down here worth whispering about, it might be more than just danger. Could be treasure, secrets… or just a really angry ghost.”

Options
Focus on Escaping: Prioritize Callum’s safety and leave the mine immediately.
Investigate Further: Explore the mine to uncover the source of the whispers.
Split Roles: Half the group escorts Callum while the rest investigates (riskier).
What does Napy decide? ​​





Du:
Let's get Callum out of here. Maybe Jedrick is still around and we can leave them at the entrance with a camp fire and supplies and return for big of extra pay
ChatGPT:
Decision: Get Callum Out Safely
Napy rises and looks at the team. “We’ve got what we came for. Let’s get Callum out of here first. If Jedrick’s still waiting at the entrance, we can leave him there with supplies and come back to investigate further. The whispers—and whatever’s watching—will still be here.”

Toran:
The dwarf nods firmly, moving to help Callum up. “Good call. Let’s not push our luck just yet.”

Lyra:
Lyra grabs her shield and readies herself. “I’ll keep an eye on him as we move. He’s stable, but he’ll need rest.”

Kael:
Kael picks up the second torch, glancing warily into the shadows. “Fine by me. Let’s hope Jedrick hasn’t bolted. I’d rather not babysit the guy myself.”

Retracing Your Steps
With Callum supported by Toran and Lyra, the group carefully retraces their path. Thanks to the earlier preparations and Napy’s sharp eye for hazards, the journey back to the mine entrance is uneventful, though the faint echoes of whispers linger behind you.

As you approach the mouth of the mine, the cold, damp air gives way to sunlight, and you see Jedrick pacing nervously near a small campfire he’s started.

Jedrick’s Reaction:
Seeing Callum, Jedrick hurries forward, his face a mix of relief and apprehension. “You found him! By the gods, I thought you’d all gotten yourselves killed. What happened in there?”

Napy’s Plan
Explain the Situation: Brief Jedrick about the whispers and ask him to watch over Callum while the group reenters the mine.
Negotiate Extra Pay: Emphasize the danger of staying and request additional compensation for continuing the exploration.
Leave Supplies: Offer supplies to Callum and Jedrick, ensuring their safety while you return to investigate.
What’s Napy’s approach?





Du:
Well, we can't get extra pay from jedrick, the mayor offered the job. With extra pay I meant that we have look around for treasure in the mine. Explain the situation though
ChatGPT:
Explaining the Situation to Jedrick
Napy approaches Jedrick, setting the rescued miner down near the campfire. He kneels, catching the older man’s gaze. “We found Callum near the collapsed vein, pinned under rubble. He’s alive, but just barely. Lyra patched him up, but he’s in no shape to move much further.”

Jedrick nods solemnly, glancing at Callum’s battered form. “What happened down there? You’ve got the look of men who saw more than rocks and dust.”

Napy leans closer, lowering his voice. “There’s something else in the mine. Callum mentioned whispers—voices in the dark, like something’s watching. We didn’t stick around to find out what. For now, we’re leaving you and Callum here with supplies and a fire. We’re heading back in to take a closer look.”

Jedrick’s Reaction:
Jedrick pales, his hands trembling as he grips his pack. “Whispers? I knew that place was cursed! You’d be fools to go back in there, but… I won’t stop you. If it’s the mine or the town, I’ll take my chances here.”

He glances at Callum. “I’ll watch over him. But don’t take too long—darkness falls quick in these woods.”

Party Preparations:

Toran sets an extra torch and some rations near the fire for Callum and Jedrick.
Lyra adjusts her shield and murmurs another quick prayer for protection.
Kael smirks. “Treasure or terror? Let’s see which one we find first.”
Returning to the Mine
As the group reenters the dark maw of the Ridgefell Mines, the oppressive atmosphere returns, the whispers faint but persistent. This time, with Callum safe, you’re free to explore deeper into the tunnels.

Next Steps:

Explore the Danger Tunnel: Investigate the source of the strange whispers.
Search for Treasure: Examine side passages or abandoned tools for hidden valuables.
Scout the Main Shaft: Assess the mine’s heart for threats or potential riches.
