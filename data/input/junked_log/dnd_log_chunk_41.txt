The supply cache was 3 days ago. Should that not heal in the mean time?
ChatGPT:
You're absolutely correct! A long rest was taken after the supply cache event, which would have fully restored all health. Napy should be at full health (12/12) at the start of this encounter.

Corrected Status:
Napy’s Current HP: 10/12 (after taking 2 damage this round).
Would you like me to adjust anything else before proceeding with Toran's turn?

Outcome
The party conducts a quick search but finds nothing of immediate value or importance on the bandits. Either they weren’t carrying much or had stashed their goods elsewhere.

Bandits Status:
The two unconscious bandits are securely tied up, ready for retrieval by the guards later.

Next Step: Targeting the Second Patrol
The party moves toward the second group of bandits. Kael prepares another diversion spell to lure the group further from the camp. Let’s see how effectively this works. ​​

The group is successfully lured far from the main camp, ensuring no reinforcements can intervene.

Engage the Second Patrol in Combat.
Ambush Using Stealth.
Attempt to Intimidate or Bluff for a Surrender.

Ambush Outcome
The party’s attempt to set up an ambush is partially successful. Lyra and Kael manage to stay concealed, while Napy and Toran inadvertently make noise that alerts the patrol.

Bandit Reaction: The bandits turn toward the sound, weapons drawn, but they’re still within range for the ambush to proceed.

Options:

Attack Immediately: Charge into combat before the bandits can regroup.
Use a Spell to Gain the Upper Hand: Have Kael cast a spell to disrupt them.
Bluff or Intimidate: Try to confuse or scare the bandits into retreating.
