Regroup, see if the dust settles in the camp and whether they come together to discuss s strategy. That will be our time to strike. Alchemists fire at the ready. The first time there is a chance to hit multiple with kaels burning hands, let's op for that. Again, Lyra should keep focussing on healing. It's a tough battle with high risks for injury or worse. 

Our team should also look how the oathbound fare. They will need a leader, and maybe one will especially prove themselves tonight

Regroup and Observe
The team quietly regroups a safe distance from the bandit camp, the Oathbound forming a semi-circle around you. The tension in the air is palpable as you and your companions scan the camp for activity. The central fire burns steadily, casting long shadows on the surrounding tents and wooden barricades. Shouts of confusion echo faintly as the remaining bandits huddle closer to the fire, likely trying to formulate a plan after losing contact with their sentries.

The bandits appear to be gathering around a larger, armored figure, whom you identify as the leader. Two lieutenants stand close by, gesturing animatedly and pointing toward the edges of the camp. Most of the others—perhaps five or six bandits—cluster together near the fire, clearly agitated but not yet organized.

Battle Plan Updates
The Alchemist’s Fire is prepared for a decisive opening attack, aimed to disrupt and weaken the clustered bandits.
Kael positions himself to use Burning Hands as soon as the enemies group tightly enough.
Lyra keeps her holy symbol ready, prioritizing healing for anyone who sustains significant injuries.
Toran readies his sword, his gaze fixed on the leader, clearly intending to challenge them directly.
Napy positions himself for stealth and sneak attacks, relying on his agility to strike where it hurts most.
The Oathbound look to you for guidance, their nerves evident. Grim and Ashara exchange a glance, seemingly ready to step up as leaders. Grim exudes a quiet confidence, while Ashara’s fiery determination is impossible to miss.

Next Steps:
Would you like to:

Launch the attack immediately, focusing on the clustered bandits and their leader?
Wait a little longer to see if the bandits consolidate further?
Split the group, assigning different tasks for the Oathbound and the adventuring party?




Du:
Let's attack then. No time like just right the f now

The Assault Begins
With the element of surprise still on your side, the team launches the attack. The bandits remain clustered around the fire, their leader mid-argument with the lieutenants. The faint crackle of flames masks the sound of your group advancing, the Oathbound spreading out for a coordinated strike.

Opening Moves:
Kael’s Burning Hands

Kael steps into position and unleashes a cone of flame toward the clustered bandits, aiming to ignite chaos and disorient the group.
Alchemist’s Fire (Toran)

Toran hurls an Alchemist’s Fire flask at the leader and lieutenants, seeking to engulf them in flames and reduce their effectiveness.
Napy’s Stealth Strike

Napy circles to flank the leader, aiming for a precise sneak attack with his rapier.
Oathbound Charge

Grim, Ashara, and the others rush forward to engage the remaining bandits, eager to prove their loyalty and prowess.
Lyra’s Blessing

Lyra casts Bless, bolstering the attacks of Kael, Toran, and Napy, ensuring they strike true in this critical moment.
Would you like to:

Roll for all opening actions now?
Focus on specific moves first (e.g., Kael’s spell, Toran’s throw)?
Add additional tactics or adjust the plan?




Du:
Sounds like the tactics are in place. Let the oathbound jump in as well and away we go

Split attacks to finish off both the leader and the lieutenants simultaneously?
Allow the Oathbound to handle the remaining bandits while the heroes focus on the lieutenants? ​​
