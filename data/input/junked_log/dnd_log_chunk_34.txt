The Deal
Napy’s words cut through the tension, offering the bandits a lifeline.

Napy:
“Here’s the deal: you surrender now, tell us everything you know about the other camps, and cooperate. In return, we’ll come to your trials and vouch for your willingness to help. Might be the difference between prison and a noose. Your call.”

The Bandits’ Reaction: The two lesser bandits immediately drop their weapons, clearly eager to avoid conflict. The leader hesitates, his pride warring with his survival instinct, but eventually sighs and lets his sword fall to the ground.

Bandit Leader:
“Fine. You win. No one’s worth dying for, least of all Varric.”

Information Gained
The bandits provide details about their operations:

Other Camps: There’s one more small camp southeast of here, with about four bandits.
Main Hideout: The main camp is heavily fortified, with traps and about a dozen bandits still loyal to Varric.
Varric’s Plans: The leader is organizing a major heist targeting a merchant caravan near Ravenstone Keep within the week.
Next Steps:
Secure the Bandits: Tie them up and deliver them to the guards.
Plan for the Remaining Camps: Decide whether to target the smaller camp next or focus on the main hideout.
Return to Town for the Caravan: Use the intel to warn the guards and prepare for Varric’s heist.

Du:
Secure the bandits and loot all valueables. Check pockets as well. If one of them carries a weapon that is valueable, we will take it, otherwise we will just place them on the ground making it obvious to anyone that there was no fight here

Securing and Searching the Bandits
The party ties up the three bandits securely, ensuring they cannot escape. A thorough search of their pockets and the camp yields some basic supplies but no significant hidden valuables.

Loot Found:

Weapons:

Rusty Sword (low value).
Shoddy Dagger (low value).
Simple Club (no real value).
Gold: 8 gp collectively among the three bandits.

Provisions: 2 days’ worth of trail rations and a half-empty waterskin.

Kael:
“Nothing special. Looks like they were barely scraping by.”

Lyra:
“At least it confirms they weren’t well-equipped. Let’s move.”

Scene Setup
The party leaves the weapons plainly visible on the ground, ensuring it’s obvious to any onlookers that no fight occurred. The campfire smolders as they prepare to transport the bandits.

Options:

Deliver the Bandits to the Guards: Return to Ravenstone Keep and collect the bounty.
Head to the Southeast Camp: Continue your efforts to weaken Varric’s forces.
Prepare for the Heist: Return to town to warn the guards about the caravan raid.

Du:
Head for the southeast camp. And see how many there are. Treat the three bandits well along the way. No need to be cruel

Journey to the Southeast Camp
The party departs from the subdued camp, leading the three restrained bandits along the trail. The journey is calm, with the captured men keeping quiet except for the occasional nervous glance at their captors.

Toran:
“You’re lucky Napy’s in charge. Most wouldn’t spare you this kind of mercy.”

Kael:
“Save your breath, Toran. Let’s just get this over with.”

Lyra:
“To err is human. To forgive, divine. Besides, they’re not putting up a fight.”

Reaching the Southeast Camp
After several hours, the trail narrows and the group comes upon another small clearing. This camp is slightly better organized, with two small tents and a larger central one. Smoke rises from a low fire, and four bandits are visible.

One Armored Leader: Patrolling the edge of the camp with a longsword.
Three Lesser Bandits: Relaxing near the fire, one sharpening a blade and two playing dice.
Options:

Scout the Camp: Observe their patrol patterns and defenses.
Approach Openly: Repeat the peaceful approach used at the last camp.
Set a Trap: Prepare for combat by rigging the surrounding area.
What does Napy decide?





Du:
Untie one of the captured bandits. Tell him that this camp can get the same deal. Surrender in exchange for our support in court. Anyone willing to take the deal should come out with their hands up. In the mean time, we shift position a bit, so we still see the camp, but our negotiatior cannot directly point towards us should they decide to attack

The Captured Bandit’s Reaction
The untied bandit hesitates, rubbing his wrists as he glances nervously toward the camp.

Bandit:
“Look, I don’t want to get hurt, but I’m not walking into that camp and risking my neck. They’re not the kind of folks who’d listen to someone like me.”

The bandit’s fear of retaliation or distrust from his former comrades outweighs his willingness to act as a negotiator.

Options:
Approach the Camp Yourself: Deliver the same deal directly to the bandits.
Set a Trap: Prepare for an ambush instead of negotiating.
Scout the Camp: Observe their behavior and patrols before deciding.

Du:
Tie him up again. Let's take this one on directly. Seems like our three captured bandits forgot that we too know how to fight

Preparing for Combat
With the failed negotiation attempt behind you, Napy signals for the party to get into position. The three captured bandits are secured once more, and the group takes up positions around the camp, ready to engage.

Toran:
“Well, it seems there’s no more talking. Let’s make this quick.”

Kael:
“Keep your wits about you. We don’t know how strong these ones are.”

Lyra:
“Remember, we’re trying to subdue them, not slaughter them.”

Stealth and Positioning
The party takes their positions, ensuring they’re not immediately visible to the bandits. Napy keeps his eyes on the bandit leader patrolling the edge of the camp.

Bandit Leader:
Noticing nothing out of the ordinary, the leader continues his slow patrol, unaware that danger is closing in.

Options:

Attack Head-On: Engage the bandits with a direct assault.
Spring an Ambush: Use surprise to incapacitate the guards before they can react.
Intimidate: Call out the bandits, demanding they surrender.
