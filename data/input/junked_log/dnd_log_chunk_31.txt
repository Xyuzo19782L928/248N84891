Checking on Edvar
After the eventful journey and safely delivering Edvar to Ravenstone Keep, the merchant expressed his gratitude and paid the agreed-upon fee of 10 gold. He also promised discounts on his wares during your time in town.

Current Gold Adjustment:
With the 10 gold from Edvar’s payment, your remaining total now stands at 39 gold instead of 29 gp.

Recap on Edvar:
Payment: Received and accounted for.
Status: Edvar is safely in Ravenstone Keep, likely setting up his merchant stall.
Discounts: If you want to purchase items from him, you’ll get a better deal.

Seeking a Bandit Bounty
The party makes their way back to the guard barracks to discuss the bandit activity west of the town. Upon arrival, the same guards you spoke to earlier are still on duty, and they greet you with mild surprise.

Guard 1:
“Back already? Thought you’d be off chasing treasure by now. What can we do for you?”

Napy:
“We heard about a bandit camp west of here. We’re planning to take care of it, but we want to make sure there’s some reward for bringing in those responsible—or at least a fee for each one we catch alive.”

Guard 2:
He scratches his chin thoughtfully. “Bandit activity’s been a thorn in our side for weeks now. If you’re serious about handling it, we’ll offer 5 gold per captured bandit, plus any loot you recover is yours to keep. Just don’t expect us to send a patrol to help—our hands are tied elsewhere.”

Terms:

Reward: 5 gold per captured bandit, no additional bounty for those killed.
Loot: Whatever you find is yours to keep.
Do you accept these terms or negotiate further?





Du:
5gp is not much for the trouble of catching them. Seems like they don't care to bring them in alive. Let's suggest then that we deal with it our way if that is their final offer

The Guards’ Final Offer
The guards exchange a look, their expressions firm.

Guard 1:
“Look, we’re offering what we can. You want to deal with the bandits your way? That’s fine by us. But don’t expect a reward for anyone you don’t bring in alive. Dead bandits don’t stand trial.”

Guard 2:
“Take it or leave it. You’ll still get to keep whatever loot you recover. That should more than make up for it.”

Final Terms:

5 gold per bandit captured alive.
No additional bounty for dead bandits, but you can keep all loot.
Do you accept these terms or leave to pursue the bandits independently? ​​





Du:
We accept in any case, we'll see how many we can actually capture. Let's get going then. Go West, as the song goes

Heading West to the Bandit Camp
The party sets out westward, leaving the bustling streets of Ravenstone Keep behind. The road narrows as it enters a dense forest, the canopy overhead filtering sunlight into scattered beams. Birds chatter in the distance, and the rustle of leaves adds a natural rhythm to your trek.

Toran:
“Bandit camps always reek of desperation. They’ll either scatter when we show strength or dig in like cornered rats.”

Kael:
“Let’s hope they’re not too organized. If they’ve got a leader worth their salt, this could be more trouble than it’s worth.”

Lyra:
“Just remember, capturing them alive means fewer lives lost—and more gold. Let’s try to keep it clean.”

Reaching the Bandit Camp
By late afternoon, you spot signs of activity: faint smoke rising through the trees and the distant sound of muffled voices. The camp appears to be nestled in a clearing, with makeshift tents and a central fire.

Options:

Scout the Camp First: Use stealth to assess their numbers and layout.
Set a Trap: Prepare an ambush outside the camp to catch anyone leaving.
Confront the Bandits Directly: Approach the camp openly and demand their surrender.
What does Napy decide?





Du:
Set a trap as an escape means if scouting goals awry. Then check their numbers and look for weak spots. We do have fire bombs so we could set the place ablaze and use the confusion to our advantage. Only problem is the cost of a fire bomb vs the low reward

Setting the Trap
Napy carefully rigs a tripwire snare along the path leading away from the camp. The trap is well-hidden, designed to catch anyone attempting to flee. With the escape route secured, he proceeds to scout the camp.

Scouting the Bandit Camp
Moving silently through the underbrush, Napy gets a clear view of the camp. It consists of five bandits:

Leader: A burly man with a longsword and an air of command.
Two Guards: Armed with spears, patrolling the perimeter.
Two Others: Sitting by the fire, one with a crossbow and the other sharpening a dagger.
The camp is rudimentary, with flimsy tents and supplies scattered around. The fire at the center offers a potential weak point if disrupted, but it’s clear the bandits are alert.

Observations:
Weaknesses: The guards’ patrol is predictable, leaving brief windows of vulnerability.
Fire Bomb Potential: The central fire could spread quickly, causing confusion but risking valuable loot.
Numbers: Five bandits, including one leader, might be manageable with a coordinated attack.
Options:

Prepare an Ambush: Set up a coordinated strike to neutralize the guards and leader first.
Use Fire Bombs: Ignite the fire to sow chaos, then strike amidst the confusion.
Demand Surrender: Approach openly and use intimidation to force them to give up.
What does Napy decide? ​​





Du:
Okay, the plan is to use the patrolling to our advantage and lure them away from the camp to capture them before the rest has a clue what's going on
ChatGPT:
The Plan: Isolating and Capturing the Guards
Napy signals the party to take up positions along the perimeter, hidden in the underbrush. The predictable patrols of the two guards provide a clear opportunity to isolate them without alerting the rest of the camp.

Execution:

Luring the Guards: Napy throws a small rock to create a faint noise in the distance, drawing one of the guards closer to investigate.
Ambush: The team will incapacitate the isolated guard silently.
Repeat: Use the same method to lure the second guard.
Let’s roll to see how well the plan works:

Stealth Check for Napy to Avoid Detection: (+5 bonus)
Attack Rolls to Incapacitate the Guards Silently: (Each attacker rolls; assume +3 to hit for the team)
Opposed Perception Rolls for the Bandits to Detect the Plan: (DC 15 to spot anything suspicious)
Rolling now!

Execution of the Plan
First Guard:
Napy’s distraction works perfectly, drawing the first guard toward the noise. The team ambushes, and Toran delivers a critical blow with the flat of his axe, knocking the guard unconscious before he can make a sound.

Camp Reaction:
However, the second guard notices the absence of his partner and raises the alarm. The other bandits grab their weapons and quickly prepare for a fight.

The Camp is Alerted
Bandits Remaining: Four (leader, one guard, two by the fire).
Positioning: The party is still hidden along the perimeter, with the unconscious guard secured.
Options:

Hold Position: Wait for the bandits to spread out and ambush them individually.
Attack Head-On: Use the chaos to strike the camp directly.
Use a Fire Bomb: Throw it into the center of the camp to create further confusion.
