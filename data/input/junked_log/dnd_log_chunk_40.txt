Let's go with the diversion to keep their numbers in manageable pieces. If they are poisoned, these groups should fall in no time

Finalizing the Plan
Captain Harlan:
“Understood. We’ll create a diversion to draw out part of their forces. Once you’ve handled the smaller groups, signal us to advance on the rest. Timing will be key.”

Preparing for the Attack
The guards prepare their diversion tactics while the party readies for the strike. The camp layout is roughly known:

Outer Patrols: Lightly armed bandits who may respond to a diversion first.
Inner Camp: Contains Varric’s tent and the bulk of his forces, likely affected by the poison.
The Plan:
The guards will set a distraction at the camp’s southern edge, pulling some bandits away.
The party will strike from the northern approach, targeting isolated groups first.
Would you like to proceed to the attack, or make additional preparations?





Du:
Let's scout ahead to see if we can spot any symptoms of the poison. Then let's go

Scouting Results
Rolls:

Napy: 18 (Success)
Toran: 18 (Success)
Lyra: 21 (Success)
Kael: 6 (Failure)
Observations:
Poison Symptoms:
Several bandits exhibit clear signs of poisoning: pale faces, sluggish movements, and some clutching their stomachs. Their morale appears low, with many seated or leaning against structures for support.

Camp Details:

Patrols: Two small groups of three bandits each are patrolling the outer perimeter.
Inner Camp: About eight bandits, including Varric, are gathered near the main tent. They appear weaker but still prepared to fight.
Notable Weaknesses:

The perimeter patrols are scattered and could be dealt with before alerting the inner camp.
The poison’s effects make a coordinated counterattack less likely.
Would you like to proceed with the planned diversion and assault, or adjust the strategy based on these observations? ​​

Kael: 15 (Success)
Outcome:
Kael’s Distraction:
Kael expertly conjures the sound of panicked footsteps and whispered voices, drawing the attention of one patrol. The three bandits immediately abandon their post, moving toward the diversion and away from the main camp.

Stealth:

Napy and Kael: Remain hidden as the bandits pass.
Toran and Lyra: A misstep from Toran causes a branch to snap, briefly alerting the bandits to movement in the area.
Bandit Reaction:
The patrol halts, weapons drawn, and begins scanning the surroundings for the source of the noise.

Options:

Engage Immediately: Strike now before the bandits can regroup or call for help.
Double Down on the Distraction: Attempt to lead the bandits further away with another spell or trick.
Attempt a Bluff: Convince the bandits there’s no threat.
What does Napy decide? ​​





Du:
Attack immediately.

Kael’s Turn (20 Initiative): Kael has the first move. Does he cast a spell (e.g., Frost Cantrip, Magic Missile) or take another action? ​​





Du:
What's the real name of the cantrip?
ChatGPT:
The official name of the "Frost Cantrip" is Ray of Frost in Pathfinder. It’s a ranged spell attack that deals cold damage and reduces the target’s speed by 10 feet for one round.

Would you like Kael to cast Ray of Frost on one of the bandits?

Yeah, good idea, let's do that

Next Turn: Toran (9 Initiative)
What does Toran do? ​​





Du:
Why is napys health so low?
ChatGPT:
You're absolutely right to question Napy's health. Let's quickly review recent combat events:

Napy’s Recent Health History:
Previous Battle (Supply Cache):
Napy was hit for 4 damage, leaving him at 8/12 HP.
Bandit Ambush:
Bandit 1 just hit Napy for 2 damage, reducing him to 6/12 HP.
So far, Napy hasn’t had any healing since these events. If you recall differently or think healing should have occurred between fights, we can adjust accordingly. Let me know!
