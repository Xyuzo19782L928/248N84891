Let's get the I formation and loot back to stoneravenkeep. We can discuss our contract with the captain, and then we can discuss setting up the oathbound properly. I am thinking we use the reward money, the gold and daggers we just found as a foundation, to provide enough initial capital for early expenses. They will still be under our command, but we will have grim and Ashara as team heads of 2 each.

Journey Back to Ravenstone Keep
The trek back to Ravenstone Keep is uneventful, the forest quiet now that the bandits have been subdued. The Oathbound, though weary, walk with a sense of pride and accomplishment. Grim and Ashara naturally fall into leadership roles, ensuring the group stays focused and organized during the march.

The spoils of the campaign—including gold, daggers, potions, and critical documents—are safely packed away, ready for review and redistribution.

Meeting with Captain Alder
You arrive at the keep just as the sun dips below the horizon, casting long shadows across the cobblestone streets. Inside the guard barracks, Captain Alder listens intently as you recount your victory and present the findings:

Gold recovered: 150 gp.
Jeweled daggers: Valued at 75 gp.
Journal and regional map: Potential intel on further bandit activity or hidden resources.
Captain Alder nods with approval, impressed by the thoroughness of your efforts. "You’ve done more than expected, and this region owes you its safety. Let’s discuss formal terms for your Oathbound venture and what support the keep can offer."

Formalizing the Oathbound
Napy proposes:

Establishing the Oathbound as a recognized mercenary group, primarily tasked with protecting trade routes and regional safety.
Using the recovered loot and daggers to fund their initial equipment and expenses.
Assigning Grim and Ashara as team heads, ensuring leadership and structure.
Maintaining oversight, with the adventuring party serving as commanders for larger-scale operations.
Captain Alder considers this proposal carefully, his expression unreadable. "A mercenary group might be just what this region needs. But tell me—how do you plan to keep them in line and ensure they don’t slip back into their old ways?"

Next Steps:
Respond to Alder’s concerns about trust and accountability.
Finalize the distribution of loot and resources for the Oathbound.
Determine what the adventuring party will focus on next: resting, planning, or another expedition.
How would you like to proceed?





Du:
That is a good point. The oathbound will only be effective if they work closely with the guard and comply with their ways. They are a mere extension of the executive branch of stoneravenkeep. If the captain is not satisfied with the services, we will directly answer to him and ensure that the oathbound will be bound to protect the trade routes as their name dictates. Let's see if that is enough for him.

Napy’s Response
Napy steps forward, addressing Captain Alder with measured confidence. "The Oathbound will serve as an extension of your authority, not a separate entity. They’ll work closely with the guard and follow your directives to maintain order and protect the trade routes. Their name itself—Oathbound—reflects their commitment to a new purpose, one tied directly to this region’s prosperity."

Napy pauses for effect, then continues, "If at any point you feel their efforts fall short or their loyalty falters, we—the adventuring party—will answer directly to you. We’ve brought them this far, and we’ll ensure they stay true to their name and purpose. This arrangement benefits everyone: the guards can focus on larger threats, the trade routes remain secure, and these individuals redeem themselves while providing a valuable service."

Captain Alder’s Reaction
Alder leans back in his chair, scrutinizing Napy and the adventuring party. His gaze flickers to Grim and Ashara, standing with quiet resolve at the back of the room. After a long silence, he nods slowly.

"I’ll admit, I was skeptical at first, but you’ve made a compelling case. If they serve as you say, and if they remain under your supervision, I’ll endorse this arrangement. The guards will provide logistical support where needed, but their success will depend on your leadership." He gestures to a guard nearby. "Draft the formal recognition. The Oathbound will operate under the jurisdiction of Ravenstone Keep, with the understanding that their actions reflect on you and this keep."

Formal Agreement and Next Steps
The Oathbound are officially recognized. Grim and Ashara step forward to acknowledge their roles as team heads. Their tasks will include regular reports to the keep and strict adherence to the laws of the region.
Resources are allocated:
The 150 gp and jeweled daggers are used to equip the Oathbound with quality gear.
The journal and map are handed to Alder for further analysis.
The adventurers retain the arcane gloves, healing potions, and smoke bomb.
What’s Next for the Adventuring Party?
Rest and regroup to prepare for your next expedition.
Investigate rumors or opportunities in Ravenstone Keep for potential leads.
Take a moment to finalize the distribution of the remaining loot among your party.
Where should we head next?





Du:
We ask alderman about the Conrract for clearing out the bandit camp. This gold should also go towards the oathbound to set up the endeavor. After that, we should regroup and plan how we will run the business in way way more detail

Discussing Payment with Captain Alder
Captain Alder listens carefully as you bring up the contract for clearing out the bandit camp. He nods in recognition. "Fair enough. You’ve delivered results far beyond what was promised. The roads are safer, the camps dismantled, and the leadership dealt with. I’ll arrange for payment immediately."

Contract Payment:

The adventuring party receives 250 gold pieces for the successful clearing of the bandit operations.
Captain Alder adds, "I’ll also assign one of our quartermasters to support the Oathbound in their initial setup. This should help them stay on track and properly equipped."
Gold Tally:

250 gp added to the Oathbound fund.
Adventurers’ gold remains at 40 gp.
Next Steps: Planning the Oathbound
You regroup with your team and the Oathbound to discuss the finer details of their operations. Points to consider:

Leadership Structure:

Grim and Ashara are already designated as team heads. Will they operate independently, or work together on assignments?
Operational Scope:

Will the Oathbound exclusively protect trade routes, or take on other mercenary work?
Oversight:

How will the adventuring party maintain control and accountability without micromanaging?
Finances and Sustainability:

The Oathbound now have solid starting capital. What percentage of their earnings will go toward reinvestment, upkeep, and eventual profit-sharing?
Would you like to focus on one aspect of planning first or address all points together?





Du:
All good points and let's get into it. 
1. Ashara and Grim work closely together. I have a plan on we will make that work later.
2. for now, we need to get into the good graces of the merchants they robbed. So let's stick with protecting convoys and trade routes
3. Ashara and Grim can ask for guidance any time. No micro managing, but they need to report once a week to us, the merchant guild and to the captain of the guard

Let's discuss finances in a second a bit more in detail. For now they need some sort of barracks, with at least 6 beds, better 8 to 10 and a couple more rooms for the operation, washing and so on. Let's see if something affordable is available and check the cost. I don't want them to sleep in the wilderness or foot the nightly bill at an inn

Exploring Housing Options for the Oathbound
To ensure the Oathbound’s success and legitimacy, the group begins searching for a suitable barracks or operational base in Ravenstone Keep. You ask around the merchants and guards for leads on affordable accommodations or unused facilities that could meet the following requirements:

Space for 6–10 beds.
Basic washing and living facilities.
Additional rooms for planning and equipment storage.
Potential Options (Preliminary Information):

Abandoned Guardhouse (on the outskirts of town):

Pros: Spacious, well-constructed, and secure.
Cons: Requires some repairs and cleaning.
Cost: 30 gp upfront, 10 gp/month maintenance.
Vacant Warehouse (near the market district):

Pros: Centrally located, plenty of space for customization.
Cons: Requires significant remodeling to suit living arrangements.
Cost: 50 gp upfront, 15 gp/month maintenance.
Private Lease (small home converted into a barracks):

Pros: Fully furnished, ready for immediate use.
Cons: Limited space; will likely need expansion if the Oathbound grows.
Cost: 75 gp upfront, 20 gp/month maintenance.
Would you like to:

Inspect any of these properties for more details?
Negotiate for a lower price or barter additional services for a discount?
Gather more options or consider alternatives?




Du:
Let's stick to the old guardhouses that sounds perfect. The funds from the oathbound are stocked enough to foot the bill for a while. Let us support with the most immediate repairs required and then sit everyone down to discuss finances, bonus structures, wages, and the share the adventurers take home. Btw. We need a cooler name than adventurers. 

After that, we should be able to determine the min cost that we can offer our services for to stay profitable
