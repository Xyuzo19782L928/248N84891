Yeah, you know what. We have done great things, let's see if there is something closer to ravenstonekeep and maybe the entry fee can be discussed, or a little perception roll finds us a "more affordable" entry. 

(Let's keep this in the fantasy realm of d&d. No need to Google real events and locations. We are just having fun. I don't plan on driven to Munich in my spare time )

Toran:
“Aye, and maybe even step into the Challenger’s Ring meself! Been too long since I had a good, honest bout outside of life-or-death stakes.”

Kael:
“Or we could wager a little and make this trip profitable. Not that I’d condone gambling, of course.” He grins.

Du:
Thank you !!

We take the premium seats. And refreshments for all. I do want to tease to ran and not going through with actually competing. But let's promise kael that if to ran actually steps into the ring, we will bet 50 gold on toes, no matter the odds.

Btw. alder? Same name as the captain if the guard? Is that a common name?

Teasing Toran
As the knights demonstrate their prowess, Napy nudges Toran with a grin.

Napy:
“Now, Toran, wouldn’t you look grand out there in full plate, unseating those lads with that big axe of yours? Maybe even take a swing at the Challenger’s Ring—show these folks what a true dwarf can do!”

Toran:
“Hah! A tempting thought, Napy. But you’d all have to chip in for me plate armor first!”

Kael, overhearing, chuckles.
Kael:
“Tell you what—if Toran enters the ring, we’ll bet 50 gold on him to win. Odds be damned.”

Napy:
“Oh, now we have to see this. Imagine the payout!”

Toran shakes his head, laughing but clearly flattered by the confidence.

The Name “Alder”
During a break in the action, the group overhears chatter about the lord presiding over the tournament.

Lyra:
“Isn’t Alder the name of the captain of the guard back in town?”

A nearby spectator, an older woman, turns and explains.
Spectator:
“Indeed, my dear. Lord Alder and Captain Alder are kin—brothers, in fact. The captain commands the city guard, while his older brother oversees the keep and its lands. It’s a proud family with a strong sense of duty.”

Knights thunder down the lists, unseating one another with spectacular skill.

What’s the plan after the tournament concludes?
What’s the call?





Du:
Let's go to the challengers ring. If to ran needs a plate armor, we can ask the bookie to lend us one. Maybe we are in luck and if not, a lot of doors open with a little bit of grease
50 gold is a good start. Is Lyra allowed to bless him or is this a non magical thing? Tell to ran to sweep the legs. Always sweep the legs - maybe he gets the reference and if not - still not bad advice :D
50 gold is a good start for the bet. Is Lyra allowed to bless him or is this a non magical thing? The deal of the bookie cuts into the 50 gold bet s little bit, but without it, to ran wouldn't be able to fight in the first place. Good thing he is wearing plate now. 

Before toran jumps in, Napy tells toran to sweep the legs. Always sweep the legs - maybe he gets the reference and if not - still not bad advice :D
Let's finalize the bet and with Titan good luck

Adventure Journal: Day 5, Late Morning
Location: Challenger’s Ring, Field of Valor
Activity: Betting 50 gold on Toran in the sparring match and preparing him for the fight.
Setting the Stage
Napy:
“We’ve put down 50 gold on you, Toran, so no pressure. Sweep the legs—it’s always the way to go.” He grins mischievously.

Toran:
“Sweep the legs? What kind of advice is that? But fine—if it works, I’ll owe you a pint!”

The bookie chuckles as he hands over a gleaming set of plate armor for Toran to borrow.

Bookie:
“Don’t ruin it, dwarf, or you’ll owe me more than your pride. And don’t think about any magic tricks—this is a non-magical bout. Keep it clean and show us what you’ve got.”

The Challenger’s Ring
The crowd gathers around the ring as Toran steps in, adjusting the unfamiliar but protective plate armor. Across the ring stands a lean, wiry fighter, wielding a longsword and shield. The opponent smirks, clearly confident in their agility over the dwarf’s brute strength.

The announcer calls out:
“In this corner, Toran the Mighty! Facing off against Sir Denrick, the Dancing Blade!”

The crowd erupts into cheers and murmurs of excitement.

The Match: Rules and Plan
Rules:

No magic, potions, or outside interference.
A clean sparring match to submission or ring out.
Plan:

Toran will rely on his strength and endurance.
The advice to "sweep the legs" might slow the agile opponent down if timed well.
Bet and Stakes
The bet of 50 gold is placed. With Toran being the underdog against the agile knight, the odds are 2:1 in favor of Sir Denrick.

Potential Winnings:

Win: 100 gold (50 gold profit).
Loss: 0 gold, plus a dented ego.
Opening Move
The bell rings, and Sir Denrick darts forward, testing Toran’s defenses with quick feints and light strikes. The crowd cheers as Toran braces himself.
