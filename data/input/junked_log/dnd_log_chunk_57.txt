Split the party. Let 3 oathbounds go with Napy and kael and 3 with Lyra and toran. Each group goes to one of the cleared out camps and then we see what we have and distribute

Erinnerung aktualisiert
The party splits into two groups and sets out toward the cleared bandit camps.

Group 1 (Southwest Camp):
Napy, Kael, and three Oathbound (Grim, Kieran, and Bran) navigate the path to the southwest. As they arrive, the site is eerily quiet, with remnants of the previous battle still evident. Napy’s sharp eyes and Kael’s arcane sense will be key in uncovering hidden caches.

Group 2 (Southeast Camp):
Lyra, Toran, and the other three Oathbound (Ashara, Orin, and Thorn) head toward the southeast camp. The terrain is rocky, and the loose stones mentioned by Grim could make scavenging challenging. Toran’s strength and Lyra’s insight will likely come in handy.

Would you like to handle each group’s scavenging rolls and exploration separately, or summarize the findings for both groups together?





Du:
Nah, let's accompany Napy. The others will do fine on their own and they can tell us what's going on when we meet back up. Let the team around Napy thoroughly search the camp

The team gathers everything into a pile, ready to bring it back for distribution. The Oathbound are visibly impressed with the teamwork.

Would you like to wait for the other group to regroup and share findings, or continue exploring the camp further? ​​

The team led by Lyra and Toran returns from the Southeast Camp with their findings.

Search Results:

Toran’s Contribution: Rolled 19 (including modifiers).

Combined Inventory from Both Groups:
From the Southwest Camp:

Weapons: Two swords and a shortbow.
Armor: Two pieces of padded armor.
Supplies: 50 feet of rope, dried rations, and a basic shield.
From the Southeast Camp:

Weapons: A longbow, handaxe, and a dagger.

Next Steps:
Would you like to:

Distribute the loot among the Oathbound and your team?
Search for additional stashes?
Plan the next course of action? ​​




Du:
Distribute the loot among the oathbound. Let them take weapons based on the preferences. Sounds like we are actually not too bad on the weapons. Shields and armor are still lacking though 
ChatGPT:
Erinnerung aktualisiert
The Oathbound gather around as you distribute the loot. They eagerly take weapons suited to their preferences, and soon each member is equipped:

Weapons Distribution:
Thorn: Longbow
Grim: Sword
Kieran: Shortbow
Ashara: Handaxe
Orin: Sword
Bran: Dagger
Remaining Supplies:
Armor:
2 Padded Armor
1 Leather Armor
Tools and Gear:
50 feet of rope
A crowbar
A pouch of nails
A basic shield
Observation:
While the Oathbound are now reasonably armed, they still lack sufficient shields and durable armor to fully prepare for upcoming challenges.

Would you like to:

Look for more armor and shields in another location?
Use your gold to purchase the missing gear?
Plan the next steps for the Oathbound’s training or mission?




Du:
Ask the oathbound about those stashes, where can we find armor and shields? And let's make sure that we distribute the armor found so far as well as the other items
ChatGPT:
The Oathbound discuss among themselves, recalling potential locations for armor and shields. Here's what they suggest:

Potential Stashes for Armor and Shields:
The Quarry Stash:

Grim: "There were tools and a few pieces of armor left near the old quarry. It’s risky, but it might still be there. Probably under some rubble."
Buried Stash at the Southeast Camp:

Ashara: "We didn’t dig too deep last time, but if we go back and clear the rocks, there might be more. I remember a crate with shields and armor bits buried nearby."
Main Bandit Camp:

Orin: "The main camp we haven’t hit yet… that’s where the better gear will be. Problem is, it’s heavily guarded."
Distribution of Current Armor:
Padded Armor (2):
Grim and Orin—being melee fighters—take these for basic protection.
Leather Armor (1):
Ashara—the burliest of the group—gets this for sturdier protection.
Tools and Supplies Distribution:
Rope (50 feet): Split between Grim and Kieran for utility.
Crowbar: Taken by Bran for its versatility.
Pouch of Nails: Left with Thorn to manage during camp setups.
Shield (basic): Assigned to Grim, who prefers extra defense.
Current Gear Status:
Weapons: Fully distributed.
Armor: Three Oathbound now have basic armor, but others remain unprotected.
Shields: Only one basic shield, more are needed.
Would you like to:

Investigate one of the potential stashes?
Scout the main bandit camp?
Use your gold to purchase additional armor and shields?




Du:
Wait, why is the main camp guarded? Who is left to guard it. We just cleared it from varric like yesterday
ChatGPT:
You're absolutely right! The main camp was cleared during the fight with Varric and the surviving bandits were either captured or dealt with. Any mention of it being guarded must be a misunderstanding.

Let’s reassess:

Main Bandit Camp Status:
The main camp was cleared, and Varric was defeated. The surviving bandits were captured and taken back to Ravenstone Keep.
This means the main camp should be abandoned now, leaving it open for exploration and scavenging without resistance.
Updated Options:
Investigate the Main Camp Again:
It’s likely there are supplies or hidden stashes we missed during the chaos of battle.
Search the Quarry Stash:
Risky, but potentially rewarding for armor and shields.
Dig at the Southeast Camp:
The buried stash under rocks might hold valuable gear.
How would you like to proceed?





Du:
Let's hit the main camp then. Let's search together and let the oathbound try to remember. We are not pressed for time, so rather be thorough 
ChatGPT:
Erinnerung aktualisiert
The team, including the Oathbound, heads back to the main bandit camp to conduct a thorough search. The site is eerily quiet now, with remnants of the battle still visible. The Oathbound exchange thoughts about possible hiding spots while everyone prepares to search systematically.

Actions to Take:
Would you like to:

Assign specific search areas to team members based on skills (e.g., Napy for stealthy areas, Toran for heavier lifting)?
Roll for perception and investigation checks to uncover hidden stashes?
Both?
Let me know how you’d like to proceed!
