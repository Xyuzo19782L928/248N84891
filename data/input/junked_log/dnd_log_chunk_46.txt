Next Turn:
Lyra’s Action.
What does Lyra do? Attack or support? ​​





Du:
What support would make sense here? Btw can you paint a picture of the scene?
ChatGPT:
A chaotic battlefield in a rugged bandit camp. A central tent is ablaze, sending flames and smoke into the twilight sky. A large, muscular bandit leader with soot-covered armor is locked in combat with a warrior wielding a shining longsword. Nearby, a cleric is holding a glowing mace, ready to strike, while a mage channels magic and a rogue readies a bow. The camp is surrounded by scattered supplies and frightened bandits scrambling in disarray. The scene is illuminated by the fiery glow of the burning tent and the flickering light of scattered torches.
Here is a depiction of the scene in the bandit camp as the battle unfolds. The chaos is palpable, with the fiery tent lighting the battlefield as your team confronts the injured Varric amidst the disarray of his camp.

Lyra’s Support Options:

Healing: If any party member (or herself) is injured and may need a boost.
Spiritual Weapon: Summon a magical weapon as a bonus action to attack Varric while she fights or supports the team.
Bless or Guidance: If Bless is still active, she can maintain it, but if another buff or a specific roll boost is needed, she could cast Guidance.
Would you like her to heal, attack, or summon Spiritual Weapon for additional offensive power?





Du:
Let's try out the spiritual weapon to see what it really does

Du:
Let's use the dagger. Can he use dash to get to a bandit that seems particularly disheveled?
ChatGPT:
Yes, Napy can use Cunning Action (Dash) to close the distance to a bandit who appears particularly disheveled or vulnerable. This bonus action allows him to cover more ground without sacrificing his attack.

Let’s roll for Napy’s attack with the Rune-Forged Dagger of Vitality against the weakest-looking bandit!
