Let's talk to Jedrick then. We can try a pint to lighten the mood before we jump to the heavy stuff. 

(Btw can you not only show my roll, but also the value require for success?)
ChatGPT:
Got it! Moving forward, I'll include not only your roll but also the difficulty class (DC) needed for success, so you can see exactly how you perform against the target. Now, let's talk to Jedrick.

Scene: The Crooked Oak Tavern
Back at The Crooked Oak, the scent of roasted meat and spilled ale fills the air. In a dark corner, you spot Jedrick Stones, a wiry old man with a grizzled beard. His hands, though calloused, tremble slightly as he nurses a mug of ale.

Kael whispers, “He looks like he’s already a few drinks in. Should be easy to loosen his tongue.”

You approach, offering a friendly nod, and buy him another pint. Jedrick eyes you warily at first but doesn’t refuse the drink.

Persuading Jedrick
To get Jedrick to open up about the mines and potentially guide you, you’ll need to roll Diplomacy again, this time against a DC of 15 (moderate difficulty for a reluctant NPC). The pint will give you a +2 situational bonus to your roll. Let’s see how Napy does! Rolling now.

# Rolling a Diplomacy check for convincing Jedrick
# Including the +2 situational bonus from the drink
situational_bonus = 2
diplomacy_roll_with_bonus = random.randint(1, 20) + diplomacy_bonus + situational_bonus
diplomacy_roll_with_bonus, 15  # Roll result and the DC for success
Ergebnis
(19, 15)
Napy's Diplomacy Roll: 19 (17 + 2 Diplomacy bonus + 2 situational bonus)
DC for Success: 15

Result: Success!

Jedrick’s Response
Jedrick takes a long swig of the fresh pint, his tense posture easing slightly. “Heh, you’re not like the usual folk who come asking about that cursed place. They just want tales to scare their children.”

He leans in closer, his voice dropping to a conspiratorial tone. “Ridgefell isn’t just deep; it’s dangerous. I remember collapses, strange noises, and even… disappearances. Most of us who worked there left after the last foreman vanished without a trace.”

After some coaxing, Jedrick agrees to guide you for 5 gold upfront. “I’ll take you to the mine’s entrance and give you a map of the first level. But no way in the Nine Hells am I going inside. Too old for that nonsense.”

Options
Accept Jedrick’s Offer (5 gold): Gain a guide to the mine and a map of the first level.
Negotiate: Try for a lower fee (Risk: failure might insult him).
Decline: Head to the mine on your own.
What’s Napy’s call? ​​





Du:
I offer him 7, but I need plans of more levels. As he worked there, this shouldn't be too much to ask
ChatGPT:
Great negotiation! Offering extra gold for additional maps is a fair counterproposal. Let’s roll a Diplomacy check to see if Napy can convince Jedrick to provide maps for multiple levels. This will be a moderate challenge, with a DC of 15 again.

Rolling now!

(6, 15)
Napy's Diplomacy Roll: 6 (2 + 2 Diplomacy bonus + 2 situational bonus)
DC for Success: 15

Result: Failure.

Jedrick’s Reaction
Jedrick squints at you, his expression hardening. “Seven gold, eh? You think I’ve kept perfect maps of a cursed, abandoned mine in my pocket all these years? You’d be lucky to get even a half-decent map of the first level.”

He sighs and takes another drink. “Look, I’ll take the five gold deal and give you what I have for the first level, but you’re on your own after that. Too many collapses and changes over the years. I couldn’t guide you through even if I wanted to.”

Options
Accept the Original Deal (5 gold): Jedrick guides you to the entrance and provides a map of the first level.
Push Your Luck: Insist on better information, though this might insult him further.
Decline Entirely: Head to the mine without him.
What’s Napy’s call? ​​





Du:
I accept his offer, but I also let him know that we are doing this to find the lost miner ( damn, I forgot his name). So if there is anything he can remember along the way or when we arrive, anything is appreciated to help him. ( I am aware that miners have a very strong brotherhood die to the insane risks they take every day, so maybe he will help)
ChatGPT:
You’re absolutely right—miners often have a strong sense of camaraderie, and appealing to that could inspire Jedrick to share more. Let’s play it out.

The Conversation Continues
Napy leans forward, his voice sincere. “Jedrick, this isn’t just about treasure or old stories. Callum—that’s the miner’s name—went missing down there. His wife’s worried sick, and the town’s on edge. I know how tight miners are. If there’s anything else you can tell us, or even just point us in the right direction when we get there, it might save his life.”

Diplomacy Check: Persuading Jedrick to Share More
This heartfelt appeal will require a Diplomacy check against DC 12 (easier due to the emotional connection). Rolling now!

Ergebnis

Napy's Diplomacy Roll: 9 (5 + 2 Diplomacy bonus + 2 situational bonus)
DC for Success: 12

Result: Failure.

Jedrick’s Reaction
Jedrick looks down at his drink, his face clouded. “Callum, eh? Poor fool. Should’ve stayed away from that cursed place. Look, I don’t know what to tell you—what’s down there isn’t natural. I’ve heard things, seen shadows where there shouldn’t be any. That place takes people.”

He pauses, then looks back at you. “I’ll help you get to the entrance and give you the map of the first level, but you’d best watch each other’s backs. The Ridgefell Mines don’t give back what they take.”

Outcome
Jedrick’s hesitation and fear prevent him from fully opening up, but he seems genuinely concerned. He finishes his drink and agrees to meet you at dawn to guide you to the mines.

Next Steps
You’ve secured a guide and a map for the first level of the Ridgefell Mines. Do you:

Prepare further in town? (Any last-minute actions or supplies.)
Rest for the night and head out at dawn with Jedrick? ​​




Du:
I mean, I am ready to get going, but now you are mentionig last minute shopping. Is there something glaringly missing?
ChatGPT:
Good question! Based on what you’ve gathered and your inventory, you’re fairly well-prepared, but here’s a quick checklist to make sure nothing essential is missing:

Current Inventory Recap:
Light Sources:

12 torches (3 each for the party). Adequate for exploring the dark mine.
Rations:

Enough food for 1 day per party member (5 total). Should cover the trip, but not extended exploration.
Rope:

2 ropes (50 ft. each). Perfect for climbing or navigating dangerous terrain.
Weapons and Armor:

Napy: Rapier, shortbow, dagger, and leather armor.
Toran: Battleaxe and chainmail.
Lyra: Light mace, shield, and armor.
Kael: Focus for spells (no need for weapons).
Healing:

No healing potions—reliant on Lyra’s cleric spells. If she runs out of spell slots, healing becomes a challenge.
Tools:

Thieves’ tools (Napy) for traps and locks.
Optional Additions:
Additional Healing Supplies:

Healing potions (50 gold each) are expensive but invaluable in emergencies.
Recommendation: Skip for now since Lyra can cast healing spells.
Crowbar:

Useful for prying open doors or rubble. Costs 2 gold, weighs 5 lbs.
Recommendation: Consider if you expect blockages or tight spaces.
Extra Rations:

If the mine takes longer to explore than expected, food shortages could become an issue.
Recommendation: Add 2 more days’ worth (1 gold total).
Lantern or Oil:

Lanterns provide longer-lasting light than torches. Oil can also serve as a weapon against certain foes.
Recommendation: Stick with torches unless you prefer the longer burn time.
Let me know if you want to pick up any of these, or if you’re ready to meet Jedrick and set out!





Du:
A crowbar could come in handy. Let's get one and increase the rations as you suggested and then get going. ( This is fun 😊😊)

Ready to Depart
At dawn, Jedrick meets your party near the edge of town, map in hand and a pack slung over his shoulder. The early light casts long shadows over the trees as the group sets out toward the Ridgefell Mines.

Jedrick walks ahead, pointing out landmarks and hazards along the way. “You’ve got everything you need, yeah? Once we get there, the real fun begins,” he mutters, half to himself.

Next Steps
The half-day journey awaits. Along the way, you might encounter wildlife, bandits, or remnants of old mining equipment. Should we:

Narrate the journey to the mine, introducing any surprises or skill checks along the way?
Skip ahead directly to the mine entrance?
Let me know! (And I’m so glad you’re having fun!) ​​
