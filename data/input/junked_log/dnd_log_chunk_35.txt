Napy’s Attack with the Rusty Dagger

Outcome
The Bandit Leader collapses, his longsword clattering to the ground as he breathes his last. His death leaves the remaining bandits visibly shaken.

Remaining Enemies:

Bandit 1 (Dagger): Hesitant and reconsidering his options.
Bandit 2 (Dagger): Glancing nervously at his companion.
Bandit 3 (Shortbow): Edging toward a possible escape route.
Options:

Demand Their Surrender: Use the leader’s death to intimidate the remaining bandits into submission.
Continue Fighting: Target the nearest bandit and maintain the assault.
Focus on the Shortbow Bandit: Prevent him from escaping.

Demanding Surrender
Napy wipes the dagger clean and steps forward, his voice calm but commanding. “Your leader is down. The guards will deal with you one way or another. Surrender now, and you might walk away with your lives—and a lighter sentence.”

The Bandits’ Reaction
The remaining bandits exchange panicked glances. The dagger-wielders drop their weapons, raising their hands in surrender. The shortbow-wielding bandit hesitates for a moment before also dropping his weapon, realizing escape is futile.

Bandit 1 (Dagger):
“Fine! We give up! Just... don’t kill us.”

Bandit 3 (Shortbow):
“This wasn’t worth it anyway...”

Outcome:
The bandits surrender, and the camp is secure.

Next Steps:
Secure the Bandits: Tie them up and decide their fate.
Search the Camp: Look for loot and evidence of their activities.
Interrogate the Bandits: Ask about other camps or Varric’s plans.
