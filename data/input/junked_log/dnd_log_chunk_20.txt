Inspect the entrance and then try to use stealth. But Maybe it's just a nice hot Underground Geysir - you never now, right? :D

Inspecting the Entrance
Napy carefully examines the entrance to the cavern. He spots faint runes etched into the boulder, similar to the ones near the lights and the creature’s remains. These runes appear inactive but might have been used as a ward to keep something in—or out.

He also notices claw marks around the base of the boulder, indicating that it was recently moved. The passage appears safe for now, but the runes suggest a connection to the dangers above.

Stealthily Entering the Cavern
With the entrance inspected, Napy leads the way quietly, motioning for the party to follow at a distance. Let’s roll for Napy’s Stealth to see how quietly he can scout ahead.

DC: 12 (to avoid making noise or alerting potential dangers). Rolling now! ​​

Entering the Cavern
Napy moves cautiously, but a loose rock shifts underfoot, sending a small cascade of pebbles tumbling into the cavern. The sound echoes through the space, breaking the silence. The rest of the party freezes, waiting for any reaction.

Inside the Cavern
The dim light reveals a wide chamber with stalactites hanging from the ceiling and an underground geyser steaming gently in the center, as if to tease Napy’s earlier joke. However, the heat from the geyser doesn’t fill the chamber—an unnatural chill lingers in the air.

What Napy Notices:

To the side of the geyser, there’s a faint glow from another rune circle, similar to the one in the mine. This one appears damaged and partially inactive.
The ground near the rune circle shows signs of a recent struggle, with claw marks and scuffed dirt.
Options:

Approach the Rune Circle: Investigate its condition and connection to the mine.
Examine the Geyser: Check for any natural or magical properties.
Scout Further: Look for additional passages or threats in the cavern.
What does Napy decide? ​​





Du:
All of those suggestions seem worthwhile. Let's check them off one by one
ChatGPT:
Exploring the Cavern
The party carefully enters the chamber, spreading out to investigate the geyser, the glowing rune circle, and the surrounding area.

Step 1: Examining the Rune Circle
Kael kneels by the damaged circle, his staff glowing faintly as he casts Detect Magic to analyze it. Let’s roll a Spellcraft check to determine its condition and purpose.

Ergebnis
(15, 15)
Kael’s Spellcraft Roll: 15
DC: 15
Result: Success

Rune Circle Analysis
Kael studies the faint glow of the rune circle and pieces together its purpose. “This was another binding circle, like the one in the mine, but it’s been partially destroyed—probably during a struggle. Whatever was bound here either escaped or is barely contained.”

He points to the faded lines. “It’s tied to the same magical source as the other runes. This could’ve been a secondary prison, or it might be leaking power into the mine.”

Step 2: Investigating the Geyser
Lyra approaches the steaming geyser, her holy symbol in hand, while Napy stands nearby, keeping watch. Let’s roll Survival (Lyra) and Perception (Napy) to learn more about it. ​​

# Rolling Survival for Lyra to assess the geyser's natural properties

Ergebnis
(10, 12, 5, 12)
Lyra’s Survival Roll: 10 (Fail)
Napy’s Perception Roll: 5 (Fail)

Investigating the Geyser
Lyra examines the geyser and determines that it’s likely a natural feature, but she’s unable to discern any connection to the magic in the cavern. Meanwhile, Napy searches the surrounding area for anything unusual but finds nothing except for the warm, wet stones around the geyser.

The geyser appears to be a harmless natural feature, unrelated to the magical disturbances.

Step 3: Scouting the Cavern
The party searches the rest of the chamber for other passages, hidden items, or threats. Let’s roll Perception checks for the group to see what they uncover. ​​

Perception Rolls:

Napy: 10 (Fail)
Toran: 4 (Fail)
Lyra: 10 (Fail)
Kael: 11 (Fail)
Scouting the Cavern
The group fans out, carefully examining the chamber’s walls and corners, but they find nothing of note beyond the geyser and the rune circle. The cavern is silent and still, with no signs of other creatures or passages leading deeper.

Summary of Findings
The rune circle was another binding ward, likely damaged during a struggle.
The geyser appears to be a harmless, natural feature.
The cavern holds no immediate threats or additional clues.
Options:

Return to Town: Bring the information and loot back to the mayor and regroup.
Investigate the Map Further: Look for other locations it might point to nearby.
Prepare a Ritual: Attempt to stabilize the damaged rune circle using Kael and Lyra’s combined abilities.
What does Napy decide? ​​





Du:
Someone brave enough to take a sip from the Geysir, otherwise I'll give it a try
ChatGPT:
The group exchanges uncertain glances at Napy’s suggestion.

Toran:
“I’ve seen worse things come out of underground springs, but if you’re feelin’ brave, have at it. Just don’t blame me if it burns your insides.”

Kael:
“Brave or foolish? Hard to tell sometimes.” He smirks but seems content to let someone else take the risk.

Lyra:
She looks concerned but doesn’t object. “If you’re going to try it, let me be ready to heal you just in case.”

Decision:
Does Napy drink from the geyser? Or does he press someone else to take the first sip?





Du:
Nah, I take a sip, I will just get something in a little flask or similar, so it can cool to a drinkable temperature

Drinking the Geyser Water
Napy fills a flask with the steaming water and lets it cool before taking a cautious sip. The taste is sharp and metallic, almost electric. Moments later, his stomach churns uncomfortably, and a cold sweat breaks out on his brow.

Effect:

Napy feels nauseous for a short time.
He suffers a -2 penalty to attack rolls and skill checks for the next hour.
Lyra:
She steps forward, concern on her face. “I told you that might not be a good idea. Sit down and let me see if I can help.”

Kael:
“Well, now we know the geyser isn’t a refreshing spring. Maybe stick to ale next time?”

Next Steps:

Have Lyra Heal Napy: Use a healing spell or skill to try and counteract the nausea.
Rest and Recover: Wait for the effects to wear off naturally.
Continue Exploring: Proceed cautiously despite Napy’s condition.
