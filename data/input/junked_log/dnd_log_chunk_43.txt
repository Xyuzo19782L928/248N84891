Kael’s HP Increase: 6 (rolled 5 + 1 Constitution modifier)

New Maximum HP: 8 (current) + 6 = 14 HP

Arcane Tradition: Kael’s Decision
Kael (thoughtfully):
"I’ve always been drawn to the raw power of evocation. There’s something about shaping pure energy into destruction or defense that appeals to me. But illusions... that subtle art of bending perception—it’s tempting too. What do you think I should focus on?"

Would you like Kael to specialize in Evocation, Illusion, or consider another school? ​​





Du:
First answer was evocation, so that sounds good. How about new spells. What does he chose to learn?
ChatGPT:
Kael’s Specialization: Evocation
Kael chooses the Evocation School, focusing on harnessing and controlling destructive magical forces. This grants him the following benefit:

Evocation Savant:

Copying Evocation spells into his spellbook costs half the normal time and gold.
Sculpt Spells:

When Kael casts an evocation spell that affects other creatures in an area, he can protect allies.
Choose a number of creatures equal to the spell’s level + 1. These creatures automatically succeed on their saving throws and take no damage if the spell allows it.
New Spells for Kael (Level 2):
Kael can choose two new spells to add to his spellbook. Here are some fitting options:

1st-Level Spells (Additional Slot Unlocked):
Magic Missile (Evocation): Automatically hits and deals reliable damage.
Burning Hands (Evocation): A cone of fire, dealing significant damage in a 15-foot area.
Other Suggestions:
Mage Armor: Protect allies with enhanced AC.
Sleep: Incapacitate weaker enemies.
Shield: Add +5 AC as a reaction.
Disguise Self: Create false appearances for infiltration.
What do you think Kael should add to his spellbook?





Du:
Doesn't he already know magic missiles? 
ChatGPT:
You're absolutely correct—Kael already knows Magic Missile and has been using it effectively in combat. That means we can focus on adding other useful spells to his repertoire.

Updated Spell Options:
Evocation Choices:
Burning Hands (Evocation): A short-range cone of fire that deals 3d6 fire damage. Great for groups.
Thunderwave (Evocation): A wave of thunderous force, dealing damage and pushing enemies back.
Utility/Control Choices:
Mage Armor: Increase an ally’s AC (great for Kael or Lyra).
Sleep: Puts enemies with low HP to sleep—excellent for crowd control.
Shield: Reaction spell that adds +5 to AC until your next turn (life-saving in combat).
Trickery/Support:
Disguise Self: Create a false appearance.
Feather Fall: Prevent falling damage for the party.
Would you like to pick two from this list, or do you have something specific in mind for Kael?
