We will let Ashara and grim know about the Bandit activity. This should be right up they alley. I think, we should look for the hunter and try to save a life, but also please get a notepad and write down to follow up with the ancient ruins. This seems interesting for later.

Plan in Motion
After briefing Ashara and Grim on the bandit activity, they acknowledge the opportunity and promise to draft a strategy with the Merchant Guild to address the issue.

The Arrowheads then prepare for the missing hunter task. The lead points to a nearby village, about half a day’s journey from Ravenstone Keep. You gather your gear and set out, leaving the bustling streets behind for the open countryside.

Would you like to take any special precautions, gather additional supplies, or speak to anyone before departing?





Du:
I am not quite sure where the family of the hunter is. In ravenstonekeep or the nearby village. In either case, let's talk to then and find out more. Let's stock up on provisions for 5 days and deduct the cost from our gold

Hunter’s Family
The family of the missing hunter resides in the nearby village, where they’ve spread word of his disappearance. The Arrowheads head out, reaching the quiet village by early afternoon. The family—a middle-aged couple and their teenage daughter—meet you at their modest home.

The father, Grent, speaks first, his voice heavy with worry. "Our son, Elric, went out to hunt three days ago and never came back. He’s a good tracker and never wanders far. We fear something’s happened to him."

The mother adds, "He often hunts in the Hollowwood, about two hours’ walk from here. Please, if you can, bring him back to us—or at least find out what happened."

Information Learned:
Elric’s Route: The family provides a basic description of the paths Elric often takes in the Hollowwood.
Usual Prey: He primarily hunts deer and small game, avoiding large predators.
Supplies: Elric carried a bow, a quiver of arrows, and two days’ worth of food.
Would you like to proceed directly to the Hollowwood or take any additional actions first? ​​





Du:
Talk to the sister. Maybe she knows more than the parents. If he didn't want his parents to know about something, maybe he still opened up to his sis
ChatGPT:
You turn to Elric’s younger sister, a shy but observant teenager. She hesitates as you address her, glancing nervously at her parents before stepping closer to you.

Her voice is soft, almost a whisper. “Elric… he didn’t tell them everything. He’s been talking about something strange he saw in the Hollowwood—something he thought might bring us good luck.”

She hesitates, clearly reluctant to share more. With gentle encouragement, she continues, “He mentioned finding an old stone ring in the forest—a circle of big, mossy rocks. He thought it might be… magical. He didn’t want to scare them, but he said he felt like he was being… watched, the last time he went there.”

Her eyes widen slightly. “Please don’t tell them I said this. They’re already so worried. I just want him to come home.”

New Lead:
Elric may have gone to investigate the stone ring in the Hollowwood. This could explain why he wandered off his usual hunting paths.

Would you like to proceed to the Hollowwood now, or take any further steps based on this new information?





Du:
Ask where this stone ring is. Then let's go. On the way let's talk to kael and Lyra and ask what they think this is
ChatGPT:
You turn back to the sister. “Do you know where this stone ring is?”

She nods hesitantly. “Elric said it’s deeper in the Hollowwood, past the usual game trails. There’s a narrow path marked by two fallen trees—it’s just a little beyond that. He said it’s hard to miss once you get close. Please, be careful.”

Journey to the Hollowwood
The Arrowheads set off toward the Hollowwood. The forest is dense and eerily quiet, sunlight filtering through the thick canopy in patches. The occasional bird call and rustling leaves are the only sounds that accompany your steps.

As you walk, Napy turns to Kael and Lyra to ask their thoughts on the stone ring.

Kael strokes his chin thoughtfully. “A stone ring? Could be old druidic ruins, or maybe a natural leyline focus. If Elric felt watched, it might mean lingering magic—or worse, a creature tied to the area.”

Lyra, more pragmatic, adds, “If it’s magical, it might explain why he felt drawn to it. But something about this feels… off. Magical places aren’t always kind to wanderers, especially those who don’t know what they’re dealing with.”

Approaching the Hollowwood
You reach the edge of the forest where the path splits. The sister’s description of the fallen trees seems accurate, and you spot the narrow trail leading deeper into the woods.

Do you wish to proceed cautiously, scout ahead, or take another approach?





Du:
Nah, let's go right in. Let's see what's going on. Let Lyra and kael have a look for any glimpse of magic along the way
ChatGPT:
The Arrowheads push forward, following the narrow trail deeper into the Hollowwood. The atmosphere grows heavier with each step, the trees closing in and casting long shadows despite the daylight. The path, though faint, is unmistakable as you navigate past the fallen trees the sister described.

Kael’s Arcane Awareness
Kael keeps a sharp eye out for signs of magic, his senses attuned to anything unusual. He mutters a soft incantation to Detect Magic, his eyes briefly glowing with arcane energy as he scans the area.

Lyra’s Perception Lyra moves carefully, focusing on subtle shifts in the air and the faint aura of anything unnatural. Her faith and training as a cleric give her a sense for divine or unholy presences.

Kael’s Findings
Kael scans the path with his magical senses but doesn’t detect any active enchantments or magical effects. He furrows his brow. “Nothing immediate... but that doesn’t mean the ring itself isn’t tied to something. Let’s stay sharp.”

Lyra’s Findings
Lyra’s keen eyes and instincts pick up subtle details along the way. She notices faint symbols etched into nearby trees, partially obscured by moss and bark. They appear old but deliberate—possibly markers for the stone ring or warnings to keep away.

“These symbols aren’t natural,” Lyra says quietly. “Someone, or something, wanted people to know this place was important—or dangerous.”

Ahead on the Trail
The path begins to widen slightly, revealing a clearing up ahead. The faint smell of damp earth and moss grows stronger, and you sense you’re getting closer to the stone ring.

Would you like to stop and examine the symbols further, or proceed directly to the clearing? ​​





Du:
Nah, screw the symbols. We will go in for the boys in any case. How important can they be
ChatGPT:
The Arrowheads press on, leaving the enigmatic symbols behind. The trail opens into a wide clearing, where the stone ring looms in the center, just as Elric’s sister described. Massive, moss-covered stones form a near-perfect circle, with an almost eerie symmetry that suggests intention rather than nature.

The air here feels cooler, heavy with an unspoken tension. Small shafts of sunlight manage to pierce the canopy above, illuminating the center of the ring where the grass appears flattened—as if something, or someone, had recently disturbed it.

The Scene
Elric’s Pack: Near the edge of the ring, you spot a small hunting pack leaning against one of the stones. It looks recently dropped.
Tracks: Lyra notices faint footprints leading into the center of the ring, then stopping abruptly.
The Stones: Strange grooves are etched into the surface of each stone, faintly glowing with a soft green hue.
Kael’s eyes narrow. “This is no ordinary place... I’m picking up faint residual magic now. Something was here recently, or maybe still is.”

What do you wish to do?

Investigate the pack.
Examine the stones.
Inspect the tracks.
Enter the ring directly.
Call out for Elric.




Du:
Examine the stones to find out what's going on here
ChatGPT:
You approach the massive stones, their towering presence radiating an ancient and otherworldly energy. The moss-covered surfaces are cold to the touch, but the faint green glow in the grooves draws your attention. It pulses rhythmically, almost like a heartbeat, as if the stones are alive in some way.

Detailed Examination
Grooves: The grooves appear to form a circular pattern that connects all the stones, though the design is intricate and seems almost impossible to decipher.
Material: The stone itself doesn’t resemble anything local—it’s smoother and darker, as if quarried from another region or even another plane.
Arcane Influence: Kael steps closer, his hand hovering above one of the grooves. “This magic… it’s old. Druidic, maybe? Or tied to the fey. It’s not destructive, but it’s not entirely benevolent either.”
Possible Interpretations (Kael’s Arcana Check: 17):
The green glow may be a ward or a protective enchantment.
The stones could serve as a gateway or focus point, drawing energy from the environment or another realm.
They may react to certain triggers—blood, an offering, or even a spoken phrase.
Lyra steps forward, her expression wary. “If Elric disturbed this ring, it might explain why he disappeared. But if these stones are connected to something beyond, we need to tread carefully.”

Would you like to:

Investigate the tracks further to see where Elric went?
Call out to see if Elric responds?
Test the stones with an offering or action?
Examine the hunting pack for clues?
