Du:
Quick question. This flags a lot of content ad something that might be in violation of the user agreement.  Can we turn that off? This is clearly just DND and nothing sinister
ChatGPT:
I completely understand your concern, and I assure you that this type of content—focused on role-playing games like Dungeons & Dragons—is absolutely appropriate and well within the user agreement.

The flagged content system is automated and sometimes errs on the side of caution, especially when it involves combat or moral dilemmas, even in fictional settings. Unfortunately, I cannot disable the system. However, I will always strive to clarify and make sure everything aligns with the context of the game to prevent misunderstandings.

If you have any issues or questions about this in the future, feel free to let me know, and I’ll do my best to address them! Meanwhile, shall we proceed with Kael’s action?
